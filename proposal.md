### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

In addition to GOOD outcome:
-Map
-Moves where user can choose which direction they want to go

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

If I am able to include all the GOOD and BETTER features, I would like to put the game on a website or find some way to make it more accessible to friends and family

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

As per Professor Rosen's recommendation, I will have object-based programming. In addition, I will need to have a cohesive and clear storyline. If I end up being able to have enough done to want to put it on a website, I would have to learn how to do that too.
